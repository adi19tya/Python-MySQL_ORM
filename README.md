# Python-MySQL_ORM
## Introduction:
This project demonstrates the basic implementation of SQL queries using MySQL. The queries are written through a Python file using a connector from the mysql.connector module. The data model is designed in the MySQL DBMS and the corresponding Object Model is written in python.

### MySQL - Python Implementation:
  1. Create a connection between from Python to MySQL.
  2. Drop a Databases
  3. Create a Department, Employee and a Salary table.
  5. Insert Data into the Department, Employee and a Salary tables.
  6. Inner Join
 
### Object Relational Mapping:
  1.  Create an Employee, Department and Salary Classes based on the Object Model
  2.  Pull data from the MySQL database and create class instances for each class.
  3.  Retrieve the Salary, Department and Employee details.
